# Configuring and Using the python "Hello, world!" desktop application with faynoSync
### Requirements
To use this application, you'll need to have Python 3 and the tkinter library installed on your computer. 

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install tkinter on your computer, you can use the package manager that comes with your operating system. 

For example, if you're using Ubuntu or Debian Linux, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
**MacOS**
```
brew install python-tk
pip3 install requests distro
```

If you're using Windows, tkinter should be included with your Python installation.

### Running the Application
To run the "Hello, world!" application, follow these steps:

Download or clone the repository to your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application is located.

Change your `App name`, `channel` if channels exist, and `version` in `config.py` to real values existing in faynoSync.

Type the following command to run the application:

```
python3 hello_world.py
```

The application window should appear with the message "Hello, world!" displayed in it and updating window if your version isn't latest.
